A sequel to Super Mario Bros. (1985), it was originally released in Japan for the Family Computer Disk System as Super Mario Bros. 2[a] on June 3, 1986. Nintendo of America deemed it too difficult for its North American audience and instead released an alternative sequel, also titled Super Mario Bros. 2, in 1988. It was renamed The Lost Levels and first released internationally in the 1993 Super Nintendo Entertainment System compilation Super Mario All-Stars. It has been rereleased for Game Boy Color, Game Boy Advance, Wii, Wii U, Nintendo 3DS and Nintendo Switch. The Lost Levels is similar to Super Mario Bros, with players controlling Mario or Luigi to rescue Princess Peach from Bowser. It adds a greater level of difficulty and Luigi controls slightly differently from Mario, with reduced ground friction and increased jump height. The Lost Levels also introduces obstacles such as poison mushroom power-ups, counterproductive level warps, and mid-air wind gusts. It has 32 levels across eight worlds and 20 bonus levels. Reviewers viewed The Lost Levels as an extension of Super Mario Bros, especially its difficulty progression. Journalists appreciated the challenge when spectating speedruns and recognized the game as a precursor to the franchise's Kaizo subculture in which fans create and share ROM hacks featuring nearly impossible levels. This sequel gave Luigi his first character traits and introduced the poison mushroom item, which has since been used throughout the Mario franchise. The Lost Levels was the most popular game on the Disk System, for which it sold about 2.5 million copies. It is remembered among the most difficult Nintendo games. Screenshot of gameplay from the 1986 Japanese release, showing a poison mushroom The Lost Levels is a 2D side-scrolling platform game similar in style and gameplay to the original 1985 Super Mario Bros., save for an increase in difficulty.[2][3][4][5] As in the original, Mario (or Luigi) ventures to rescue the Princess from Bowser.[4] The player jumps between platforms, avoids enemies and obstacles, finds secrets (such as warp zones and vertical vines) and collects power-ups such as the mushroom (which makes Mario grow), the Fire Flower (which lets Mario throw fireballs), and the Invincibility Star.[2] Unlike the original, there is no two-player mode,[6] but at the title screen the player chooses between Mario or Luigi. Their abilities are differentiated for the first time: Luigi, designed for skilled players, has a longer time accelerating and slowing down, but has a higher jump height,[2] while Mario is the opposite; he has a faster time accelerating and slowing down, but has a lower jump height.[6] The Lost Levels continues the difficulty progression from Super Mario Bros.[2] It introduces obstacles including poison mushrooms, warps that return the player to previous levels, and gusts that redirect the player midair.[3] The poison mushroom, in particular, works as an anti-mushroom, shrinking or killing the player character.[7] Some levels require \"split-second\" precision[3] and others require the player to jump on invisible blocks.[8] There were also some graphical changes,[5][9] though their soundtracks are identical.[2] After each boss fight, Toad tells Mario that \"[their] princess is in another castle\".[3] The main game has 32 levels[1] across eight worlds and five bonus worlds. A hidden World 9 is accessible if the player does not use a warp zone. Bonus worlds A through D are accessible when the player plays through the game eight times, for a total of 52 levels.[2] The game's director, designer, and composer pictured together in 2015: Takashi Tezuka, Shigeru Miyamoto, and Koji Kondo. The original Super Mario Bros. was released in North America in October 1985. When developing a version of the game for Nintendo's coin-operated arcade machine, the VS. System, the team experimented with new, challenging level designs. They enjoyed these new levels, and thought that Super Mario devotees would too.[10] Shigeru Miyamoto, who created the Mario franchise and directed Super Mario Bros., no longer had time to design games by himself, given his responsibilities leading Nintendo's Nintendo R&D4 division and their work on The Legend of Zelda (1986).[3] The Super Mario sequel was delegated to its predecessor's assistant director, Takashi Tezuka, as his directorial debut.[11][12] He worked with Miyamoto and the R&D4 team[13][2] to develop a sequel based on the same underlying technology,[7] including some levels directly from Vs. Super Mario Bros.[3] The Lost Levels, originally released in Japan as Super Mario Bros. 2[4] on June 3, 1986, was similar in style to Super Mario Bros. but much more difficult in gameplay – \"nails-from-diamonds hard\", as Jon Irwin described it in his book on the sequels.[11] Tezuka felt that Japanese players had mastered the original game, and so needed a more challenging sequel.[11] Recognizing that the game might be too difficult for newcomers, the team labeled the packaging with \"For Super Players\".[10] They also added a trick to earn infinite lives as preparation for the difficulty.[10] Japanese commercials for The Lost Levels featured players screaming in frustration at their televisions.[11] After Zelda, The Lost Levels was the ninth release for the Famicom Disk System, an add-on external disk drive with more spacious and less expensive disks than the Famicom cartridges.[3] As I continued to play, I found that Super Mario Bros. 2 asked me again and again to take a leap of faith, and each of those leaps resulted in my immediate death. This was not a fun game to play. It was punishment – undeserved punishment. I put down my controller, astonished that Mr. Miyamoto had chosen to design such a painful game. Howard Phillips on his test playthrough of The Lost Levels[11] When evaluated for release outside of Japan, Nintendo of America believed The Lost Levels was too difficult and frustrating for the recovering American market and declined its release.[3][14] Howard Phillips, who evaluated games for Nintendo of America President Minoru Arakawa, felt it was unfairly difficult, even beyond the unofficial moniker of \"Nintendo Hard\" that the company's other games sometimes garnered.[11] His opinion was that The Lost Levels would not sell well in the American market.[13][11] He later recalled that \"few games were more stymieing. Not having fun is bad when you're a company selling fun\".[11] Nintendo instead released a retrofitted version of Fujisankei Communications Group's Doki Doki Panic as the region's Super Mario Bros. 2 in October 1988.[15] Doki Doki Panic had originally been developed by Kensuke Tanabe. Tanabe was instructed to use characters from Y\u016bme Kojo '87 and was released in Japan as a standalone game on July 10, 1987. Doki Doki Panic's characters and artwork were modified to match Super Mario Bros. before being released in America, and the re-skinned release became known as the \"big aberration\" in the Super Mario series.[3] The American Super Mario Bros. 2 was later released in Japan as Super Mario USA.[15] The Lost Levels was the ninth game released for the Famicom Disk System (attached below the Famicom, as pictured). Nintendo \"cleaned up\" parts of the Japanese Super Mario Bros. 2 and released it in later Super Mario collections as The Lost Levels.[3] Its North American debut in the 1993 Super Mario All-Stars collection for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System[4] featured updated graphics (including increased visibility for the poison mushroom[6]) and more frequent checkpoints to save player progress.[7] According to All-Stars developers, the compilation was created because Miyamoto felt The Lost Levels had not reached a wide audience and wanted more players to experience it.[16] All-Stars was rereleased as a Limited Edition for the Nintendo Wii console in remembrance of Super Mario Bros.'s 25th anniversary in 2010.[15] The Lost Levels was edited to fit the handheld Game Boy Color screen as an unlockable bonus in the 1999 Super Mario Bros. Deluxe: the visible screen is cropped and some features are omitted, such as the wind and five bonus worlds.[17][18] The Lost Levels was rereleased in 2004 for the Game Boy Advance on the third volume of Nintendo's Japan-only Famicom Mini compilation cartridges.[19] Nintendo's Virtual Console digital platform introduced North America and Europe to the unedited 1986 Japanese release.[2][6] The Lost Levels was released for multiple Nintendo platforms: the Wii's Virtual Console in 2007 (partially in support of Nintendo's Hanabi Festival[6]), the 3DS's in 2012,[20][2] the Wii U's in 2013,[20] and the Switch's NES catalog in 2019.[21] Nintendo's 2014 classic game compilations NES Remix 2 (Wii U) and Ultimate NES Remix (3DS) included selections from The Lost Levels.[22][23] For the series' 35th anniversary, in late 2020, Nintendo included The Lost Levels in a limited edition Game & Watch device.[24][25] Reception and legacy[edit] The Lost Levels topped Famicom Ts\u016bshin's charts.[11] It was the most popular game on the Disk System, for which it sold about 2.5 million copies.[1] Retrospective critics viewed The Lost Levels as an expansion of the original,[2][1][5][6] akin to extra challenge levels tacked on its end.[2] Despite their similarities, the sequel is distinguished by its notorious difficulty.[20] 1001 Video Games You Must Play Before You Die summarized it as both \"familiar and mysterious\" and \"simply rather unfair\".[8] The Lost Levels replaced the original's accessible level designs with \"insanely tough obstacle courses\"[3] as if designed to intentionally frustrate and punish players beginning with its first poison mushroom.[26][20][2] Retrospective reviewers recommended The Lost Levels for those who mastered the original, or those who would appreciate a painful challenge.[20][6][27] Casual Mario fans, GameZone wrote, would not find much to enjoy.[27] Nintendo Life's reviewer felt that while Super Mario Bros. was designed for recklessness, The Lost Levels taught patience, and despite its difficulty remained fun and \"fiendishly clever\".[20] On the other hand, GamesRadar felt it was an unoriginal, boring retread, and apart from its \"pointlessly cruel\" difficulty, not worthy of the player's time.[28] GamesRadar and IGN agreed with Nintendo of America's choice against releasing the harder game in the 1980s,[28][2] though Eurogamer thought that The Lost Levels was \"technically a much better game\" than the Doki Doki Panic-based Super Mario Bros. 2 the American market received instead.[6] The Lost Levels is remembered as among the most difficult video games.[29][30] In 2015, Kotaku wrote that the precision required in The Lost Levels made fast playthroughs (speedruns) \"remarkably fun\" to spectate.[14] NES Remix 2 (2014), a compilation for the Wii U, similarly segmented The Lost Levels into speedrun challenges, which made the challenging gameplay more palatable.[22] Many years after the release of The Lost Levels, fans of the series would modify Mario games to challenge each other with nearly impossible levels. The challenges of The Lost Levels presaged this Kaizo community, and according to IGN, The Lost Levels shares more in common with this subculture than with the Mario series itself.[2] Indeed, the sequel is remembered as a black sheep in the franchise[8][20] and a reminder of imbalanced gameplay in Nintendo's history.[8] Luigi received his first distinctive character traits in The Lost Levels: less ground friction, and the ability to jump farther.[3] IGN considered this the most significant change, though the controls remained \"cramped\" and \"crippled\" with either character.[2] The poison mushroom item, with its character-impairing effects, became a staple of the Mario franchise.[b] Some of the Lost Levels appeared in a 1986 promotional release of Super Mario Bros., in which Nintendo modified in-game assets to fit themes from the Japanese radio show All Night Nippon.[39] Journalists have ranked The Lost Levels among the least important in the Mario series[40][41] and of Nintendo's top games.[26] ^ Japanese: \u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc\u30de\u30ea\u30aa\u30d6\u30e9\u30b6\u30fc\u30ba2, Hepburn: S\u016bp\u0101 Mario Buraz\u0101zu Ts\u016b ^ Games that featured the mushroom include Super Mario Kart (1992),[31][32] Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door (2004),[33] Mario & Luigi: Partners in Time (2005),[34] Mario Kart Arcade GP 2 (2007),[31] Super Mario 3D Land (2011),[35] and Mario Party: Star Rush (2016).[36] It also appears in Mario-themed games outside the franchise, such as Puzzle & Dragons Super Mario Bros. Edition[37] and the Wii U version of Tekken Tag Tournament 2.[38] ^ Jump up to: a b c d \"Super Mario Bros. 2\". Atari HQ. May 4, 1999. Archived from the original on March 11, 2015.

Howard Phillips on his test playthrough of The Lost Levels[11] When evaluated for release outside of Japan, Nintendo of America believed The Lost Levels was too difficult and frustrating for the recovering American market and declined its release.[3][14] Howard Phillips, who evaluated games for Nintendo of America President Minoru Arakawa, felt it was unfairly difficult, even beyond the unofficial moniker of "Nintendo Hard" that the company\'s other games sometimes garnered.[11] His opinion was that The Lost Levels would not sell well in the American market.[13][11] He later recalled that "few games were more stymieing. Not having fun is bad when you\'re a company selling fun".[11] Nintendo instead released a retrofitted version of Fujisankei Communications Group\'s Doki Doki Panic as the region\'s Super Mario Bros.\xa02 in October 1988.[15] Doki Doki Panic had originally been developed by Kensuke Tanabe. Tanabe was instructed to use characters from Y\u016bme Kojo \'87 and was released in Japan as a standalone game on July 10, 1987. Doki Doki Panic\'s characters and artwork were modified to match Super Mario Bros. before being released in America, and the re-skinned release became known as the "big aberration" in the Super Mario series.[3] The American Super Mario Bros.\xa02 was later released in Japan as Super Mario USA.[15] The Lost Levels was the ninth game released for the Famicom Disk System (attached below the Famicom, as pictured). Nintendo "cleaned up" parts of the Japanese Super Mario Bros.\xa02 and released it in later Super Mario collections as The Lost Levels.[3] Its North American debut in the 1993 Super Mario All-Stars collection for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System[4] featured updated graphics (including increased visibility for the poison mushroom[6]) and more frequent checkpoints to save player progress.[7] According to All-Stars developers, the compilation was created because Miyamoto felt The Lost Levels had not reached a wide audience and wanted more players to experience it.[16] All-Stars was rereleased as a Limited Edition for the Nintendo Wii console in remembrance of Super Mario Bros.\'s 25th anniversary in 2010.[15] The Lost Levels was edited to fit the handheld Game Boy Color screen as an unlockable bonus in the 1999 Super Mario Bros. Deluxe: the visible screen is cropped and some features are omitted, such as the wind and five bonus worlds.[17][18] The Lost Levels was rereleased in 2004 for the Game Boy Advance on the third volume of Nintendo\'s Japan-only Famicom Mini compilation cartridges.[19] Nintendo\'s Virtual Console digital platform introduced North America and Europe to the unedited 1986 Japanese release.[2][6] The Lost Levels was released for multiple Nintendo platforms: the Wii\'s Virtual Console in 2007 (partially in support of Nintendo\'s Hanabi Festival[6]), the 3DS\'s in 2012,[20][2] the Wii\xa0U\'s in 2013,[20] and the Switch\'s NES catalog in 2019.[21] Nintendo\'s 2014 classic game compilations NES Remix 2 (Wii U) and Ultimate NES Remix (3DS) included selections from The Lost Levels.[22][23] For the series\' 35th anniversary, in late 2020, Nintendo included The Lost Levels in a limited edition Game & Watch device.[24][25] Reception and legacy[edit] The Lost Levels topped Famicom Ts\u016bshin\'s charts.[11] It was the most popular game on the Disk System, for which it sold about 2.5\xa0million copies.[1] Retrospective critics viewed The Lost Levels as an expansion of the original,[2][1][5][6] akin to extra challenge levels tacked on its end.[2] Despite their similarities, the sequel is distinguished by its notorious difficulty.[20] 1001 Video Games You Must Play Before You Die summarized it as both "familiar and mysterious" and "simply rather unfair".[8] The Lost Levels replaced the original\'s accessible level designs with "insanely tough obstacle courses"[3] as if designed to intentionally frustrate and punish players beginning with its first poison mushroom.[26][20][2] Retrospective reviewers recommended The Lost Levels for those who mastered the original, or those who would appreciate a painful challenge.[20][6][27] Casual Mario fans, GameZone wrote, would not find much to enjoy.[27] Nintendo Life\'s reviewer felt that while Super Mario Bros. was designed for recklessness, The Lost Levels taught patience, and despite its difficulty remained fun and "fiendishly clever".[20] On the other hand, GamesRadar felt it was an unoriginal, boring retread, and apart from its "pointlessly cruel" difficulty, not worthy of the player\'s time.[28] GamesRadar and IGN agreed with Nintendo of America\'s choice against releasing the harder game in the 1980s,[28][2] though Eurogamer thought that The Lost Levels was "technically a much better game" than the Doki Doki Panic-based Super Mario Bros.\xa02 the American market received instead.[6] The Lost Levels is remembered as among the most difficult video games.[29][30] In 2015, Kotaku wrote that the precision required in The Lost Levels made fast playthroughs (speedruns) "remarkably fun" to spectate.[14] NES Remix 2 (2014), a compilation for the Wii U, similarly segmented The Lost Levels into speedrun challenges, which made the challenging gameplay more palatable.[22] Many years after the release of The Lost Levels, fans of the series would modify Mario games to challenge each other with nearly impossible levels. The challenges of The Lost Levels presaged this Kaizo community, and according to IGN, The Lost Levels shares more in common with this subculture than with the Mario series itself.[2] Indeed, the sequel is remembered as a black sheep in the franchise[8][20] and a reminder of imbalanced gameplay in Nintendo\'s history.[8] Luigi received his first distinctive character traits in The Lost Levels: less ground friction, and the ability to jump farther.[3] IGN considered this the most significant change, though the controls remained "cramped" and "crippled" with either character.[2] The poison mushroom item, with its character-impairing effects, became a staple of the Mario franchise.[b] Some of the Lost Levels appeared in a 1986 promotional release of Super Mario Bros., in which Nintendo modified in-game assets to fit themes from the Japanese radio show All Night Nippon.[39] Journalists have ranked The Lost Levels among the least important in the Mario series[40][41] and of Nintendo\'s top games.[26] ^ Japanese: \u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc\u30de\u30ea\u30aa\u30d6\u30e9\u30b6\u30fc\u30ba2, Hepburn: S\u016bp\u0101 Mario Buraz\u0101zu Ts\u016b ^ Games that featured the mushroom include Super Mario Kart (1992),[31][32] Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door (2004),[33] Mario & Luigi: Partners in Time (2005),[34] Mario Kart Arcade GP 2 (2007),[31] Super Mario 3D Land (2011),[35] and Mario Party: Star Rush (2016).[36] It also appears in Mario-themed games outside the franchise, such as Puzzle & Dragons Super Mario Bros. Edition[37] and the Wii\xa0U version of Tekken Tag Tournament 2.[38] ^ Jump up to: a b c d "Super Mario Bros. 2". Atari HQ. May 4, 1999. Archived from the original on March 11, 2015.

He was a reserve crew member of the 1978 Soyuz 30 space mission. Zenon Jankowski was born on 22 November 1937 in the city of Pozna\u0144, Poland, into a working class family. In 1956, he graduated the Marcin Kasprzak High School (now known as the St. John Cantius High School) in Pozna\u0144.[1][2] In 1956, he enrolled in the Officer Flight School No. 5 in Radom, Poland, and in 1957, he transferred to the Polish Air Force University in D\u0119blin, Poland. On 13 March 1960, he had graduated and was passed out with the rank of second lieutenant, and later the same year, was given the rank of lieutenant. Prior to his graduation, he became a flight instructor. Following his graduation, from 1960 to 1962, he taught second standard-bearer officer cadets how to pilot MiG-15 jet-powered fighter aircraft. Since 1962, he served in the fighter-bomber unit in the Polish People's Army Air Force.[1][2] Since 1964, he was a member of the Polish United Workers' Party.[3] In 1966, he was sent to the Academy of the General Staff of the Polish Army, which he graduated in 1969. Following his graduation, he served in the fighter-bomber unit, where he was the commander of the fighter-bomber flight unit, squadron's rifle service chief, squadron commander, and air regiment navigator. In 1976, he became the deputy commander of the air regiment, and was given the rank of lieutenant colonel.[1][2] In 1976, Jankowki was included in the list of ten potential candidates to become astronauts from Poland, in the Interkosmos Soviet space program. By that time, he had spent over two thousand hours piloting planes. The candidates had spent two weeks training in Zakopane, following which, from them were chosen five people to the next phase of training and tests that took place in Poland and the Soviet Union. They were: Andrzej Buga\u0142a, Henryk Ha\u0142ka, Miros\u0142aw Hermaszewski, Zenon Jankowski, and Tadeusz Kuziora. Shortly after, Andrzej Buga\u0142a was excluded from the list, with the remaining candidates continuing their tests and training, which lasted from October to November 1976.[4][5] On 27 November 1976, Hermaszewski and Jankowski were chosen as the two final candidates, and on 4 December 1976, they began their training in the Yuri Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center, located in Zvyozdny gorodok, Soviet Union.[4] In July 1977, the candidates from Poland and Soviet Union were divided into pairs. Jankowski was paired up with Valery Kubasov, an engineer, who became the leader of their group. On 25 June 1978, was decided, that Pyotr Klimuk and Miros\u0142aw Hermaszewski, would be the primary crew, while Kubasov and Jankowski, a reserve crew, of the Soyuz 30 spacecraft mission.[4] Two days later, on 27 June 1978, the mission, with Klimuk and Hermaszewski on board, had begun, with the spacecraft reaching the orbit and docking to the Salyut 6 space station.[4][6] Duration of the mission, until 5 July 1978, Jankowski served as a consultant of flight director.[4][7] Later, he returned to the service in the Polish People's Army Air Force. He eventually retired, with the rank of colonel.[7] After retiring, he moved to the town of Lubo\u0144, located near the city of Pozna\u0144, Poland.[4] Jankowki has a wife, with whom, he has one child.[1] He resides in the town of Lubo\u0144, located near the city of Pozna\u0144, Poland.[4] In 1978, Poczta Polska (Polish Post) had printed postage stamps, depicting Zenon Jankowki, with the caption reading The first Pole in space (Polish: Pierwszy Polak w kosmosie). Identical postage stamps, depicting Miros\u0142aw Hermaszewski were also printed. Both versions were made ahead of the start of Soyuz 30 mission, as it was not decided yet, who would be chosen for the mission. Following Hermaszewski being chosen for the mission, the stamps of Jankowki were ordered to be destroyed. However, around 800 stamps that were sent to a distributor in the United States, had survived.[4][8] The history of Jankowki was depicted in 1978 documentary films Zenon Jankowski, and Wita was Polska. Both films were written and directed by Bohdan \u015awi\u0105tkiewicz, and made by Wytwórnia Filmowa Czo\u0142ówka (Czo\u0142ówka Film Studio).[9][10] ^ Jump up to: a b c d \"Zenon Jankowski\". astronaut.ru (in Russian). ^ Jump up to: a b c \"Eks-kosmonavty.
