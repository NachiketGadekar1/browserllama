Extract this folder and run 'install.bat' to install the native application.

If the native-host does not launch after clicking 'connect to ai' in the extension , make sure that this key exists in the registry:
HKCU\Software\Google\Chrome\NativeMessagingHosts\com.google.chrome.example.echo . Try running install_host.bat in the host directory directly.
